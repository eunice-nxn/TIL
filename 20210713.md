## 1 The boot loader

   - BIOS
        * Find a bootable disk and a first sector of the disk is loaded on memory as boot sector
        * Boot sector : The first 512 byte sector
            + instrcutions that load the kernel into memory
        * Jump to CS:IP = 0000:7c00
        * control of a machine is passed to boot loader

   - Boot Loader

                      thus, the virtual address should be mapped into physical address of kernel
                           
## 2 Diary

        
        The concept of loading kernel by boot loader is not familiar to me. 
        The tutorial guided me to trace each line of code or assembly file with detail explanation, 
        I did understand flow of loading kernel. Using gdb debugger, It was interesting that 
        we directly accessed specific memory address and checked the data of them or invalid result of execution.
        Between Computer architecture and Operating System, I solved the what i was wondering. 
        My knowlege fell short, however, I would try on and on to fill in the gaps between what i don't know and what I exactly know
