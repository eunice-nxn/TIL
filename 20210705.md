## 1 select and pselect

   - select()

                int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, 
                            fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout);
        
      - It can monitor only file descriptors numbers that are less than FD_SETSIZE
      - arguments 
          * nfds : the highest file descriptor in any three set of file descriptors plus 1
          * timeout : this specifies the interval that select() should block waiting 
                        for a file descriptor to become ready the following cases:
                      + a file descriptor becomes ready
                      + the call is interrupted by a signal handler
                      + the timeout expires
          * sigmask : a pointer to a signal mask
  
      - Three independent sets of file descriptors are observed
          * readfds : It is used to see if a read will not block
          * writefds : It is used to if space is available for write
          * exceptfds : It is used for exceptional conditions
      - macros
          * FD_ZERO : It clears file descriptor sets.
          * FD_SET : It is an operation adding file descriptor into fd sets
          * FD_CLR : It removes a specific file descriptor in sets
          * FD_ISSET : It tests whether the fiel descriptor is part of the set
    - pselect()
 
 
                 int pselect (int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds,
                               fd_set *exceptfds, const struct timespec *timeout,
                               const sigset_t *sigmask);
        
        

       - Except that timeout argument, it is equivalent to atomically executing the following calls
            
               sigset_t origmask;
               
               pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &sigmask, &origmask);
               ready = select(nfds, &readfds, &writefds, &exceptfds, timeout);
               pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &origmask, NULL);

       - To prevent race conditions, the pselect() is needed when one wants to wait for either a signal
          or for a file descriptor to become ready

      - return value : the number of file descriptors in the three returned descriptors set
         * when return value is 0, the timeout expires before anything interesting happens
         * when return value is -1, it is on error, and errno is set to indicate the error
                  + EBADF : invalid file descriptor
                  + EINTR : A signal was caught
                  + EINVAL : nfds is negative or exeeds the RLIMIT_NOFILE resource limit
                        The value containerd within timeout is invalid
                  + ENOMEM : Unable to allocate memory for internal tables


## 2 Diary

      I have to understand concepts of Asynchronous, Synchronous, blocking and nonblocking.
      I should have implemented the chatting server program using tcp 
      when disabling naygle's algorithm. Furthermore, considering multithread 
      with race condition when programming helps me to read library documents in detail 
      and good environment to concentrate requirements of program. Because it is critical
      to understand each concept to need for implementation, connects them in one flow, 
      and conquering the solution of subproblems into one solution of big problem. 
     
      It is not easy but I realized the importance of attitude not to give up.
      I expect that the time to be patient and not to give up complicated problem today 
      is not waset of time or effort.
