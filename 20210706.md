# System Programming Study_Day_7

## 1 blocking and non blocking

   - blocking : It is blocked until the system call is complete
   - non blocking : Instead of completing I/O, an operation return an error code 
                    indicating that the command could not be immediately satisfied.
     EX) connect() return value
          - return 0 : the connection was successful, which is used for blocking mode
          - return EINPROGESS : the connection is in progress, which is used for non blocking mode
      
      * To set non blocking mode, there are steps when server is connected with client.
        
        1. For non-blocking I/O, set the socket to non-blocking operation using fcntl function
            
              int flag = fcntl (listen_fd, F_GETFL, 0);
              if( fcntl(listen_fd, F_GETFL, flag | O_NONBLOCK) < 0){
                  perror("fcntl error - O_NONBLOCK\n");
                  exit(1);
              }
              
        2. call connect() and check the return code from this function
        
              int conn_result = connect(sock_fd, (struct sockaddr *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
              if (conn_result == 0){
                      printf("The connection is successful!\n");
              }
              else if ( EINPROGRESS == errno ){ /* Non-blocking mode */
                      pthread_t recv_t, send_t;

                      if( pthread_create(&send_t, NULL, send_message, (void*) &sock_fd) != 0){
                              perror("pthread create");
                              exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                      }

                      if( pthread_create(&recv_t, NULL, receive_message, (void*) &sock_fd) != 0){
                              perror("pthread create");
                              exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                      }

                      pthread_join(send_t, NULL);
                      pthread_join(recv_t, NULL);

              } else {
                      perror("connect failed : ") ;
                      exit(EXIT_FAILURE) ;
              }
              
              * When a return value is zero, it means that the connection between server and client is successful.
              * When a return value is an error code of EINPROGRESS, it indicates that the TCP connection is progress.
              * When a return value is any other error code, it means that the actual error occurs.

        
           

## 2 inotify

  - inotify is monitoring events in file system
  - inotify_init : This makes an inotify instance
  - inotify_add_watch : This manipulates "watch list" which means the list is monitered by inotify
  - inotify_rm_watch : This remmoves item in inotify watch_list
  - inotify events
        * IN_ACCESS : The file is accessed
        * IN_DELETE : The file is deleted
        * IN_MODIFY : The file is modified
        * IN_OPEN : The file is opened
        * IN_ISDIR : The events occurs in directory


## 2 Diary

      I referenced that 'Hands-On Network Programming' for understanding non-blocking I/O 
      using 'oreilly.com'. I spent a lot of time reading the part realted with 'fshare'. 
      I repeatedly read the parts which i didn't not understand well 
      to clarify the ambiguity involved in the definition or usage of library. 
      I worried that reading books takes more time than document of man page, 
      but each compact explanation of author helps me to concentrate one concept clearly.
      
      When the connect() returned error code 'EINPROGRESS' in my code, 
      I had a difficulty to figure out directly and understand it means 'the non-blocking mode' 
      which is the control returned directly before completing I/O. 
      Author explained the case of flow in non-blocking mode using fcntl(), connect(), and select().
      Thus, I solved the incomprehensible things in studying non-blocking mode.
