  - IP Addresses
      - the feature of address
          * IP address struct

                    struct in_addr {
                      uint32_t s_addr;
                    };

          * network byte order : IP addresses are stored in memory in network byte order
              + htonl : convert uint32_t from host to network byte order
              + htons : convert uint16_t from host to network byte order
              + htohl : convert uint32_t from network to host byte order
              + ntohs : convert uint16_t from network to host byte order
          * Function for converting between binary IP addresses and dotted decimal strings
              + inet_pton : dotted decimal string -> IP address in network byte order
              + inet_ntop : IP address in network byte order -> dotted decimal string
              + n denotes network and p denotes presentation

  - Internet Connections
      - connection : clients and servers communicate by sending streamms of bytes over connections.
          * point-to-point : connects a pair of processes
          * Full-duplex : data can flow in both directions at the same time
          * Reliable : stream of bytes sent by the source is eventually received 
                        by the destination in same order it was sent
      - socket : endpoint of a connection
          * socket address : IPaddress:port pair
      - port : 16 bit integer that identifies a process
          * Ephemeral port : assigned automatically by client kernel when client makes a connection request
          * Well-known port : associated with some service provided by a ICANN
      - Anatomy of a connection
          * a connection is uniquely identified by the socket addresses of its endpoint
          * (cliaddr:cliport, servaddr:servport)
          * ex ) client host address : 128.2.194.242  | port: 51213 
                 client socket address : 128.2.194.242:51213
                 server host address : 208.216.181.15 | port.: 80
                 server socket address : 208.216.181.15:80
                 connection socket pair.: ( 128.2.194.242:51213, 208.216.181.15:80)
                 
  - Sockets
      - It is a endpoint of communication in terms of kernel and a file descriptor in terms of application.
          * clients and servers communicate with each other by reading from and writing to socket descriptors
          * file I/O vd socket I/O is different in aspects of how the applicatoin "opens" the socket descriptor
          * Socket Address Structures
              + address arguments for connect, bind and accept
              + Generic socket address
                   
                      struct sockaddr {
                          uint16_t sa_family;
                          char     sa_data[14];
                      }
                      
              + Internet-specific socket address
                      
                      struct sockaddr_in {
                        uint16_t        sin_family;   /* Protocol family (always AF_INET) */
                        unit16_t        sin_port;     /* Port num in network byte order */
                        struct in_addr  sin_addr;     /* IP addr in network byte order */
                        unsigned char   sin_zero[8];  /* Pad to sizeof(struct sockaddr) */
                      }
                      
              + Must cast(struct sockaddr_in *) to (struct sockaddr *) to functions that take socket address arguments

## 2 Diary

      We remainded together the feature of the pointer through void pointer as arguments in pthread_create
      and pointer type concept in C. I recognized what does the call by value in C means exactly.
      We often may misunderstand that there is a 'call by reference' in C. 
      However, it is wrong that the pointer is connected with the concept of 'call by reference'. 
      Because the pointer is just a place to store the address of memory.
      
      I was impressed that the void pointer argument in pthread_create function means 
      that the address of place which the code snippets for a specific function body is stored.
      In this point, i figured out the meaning of expression "there isn't 'call by reference' in C" 
      in detail than before. I realized how the c programming language is imporatnt in understanding of computer.
