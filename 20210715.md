## 1 Abstracting physical resources for strong isolation

   - The reason of strong isolation
        * It's typical that applications to not trust each other and have bugs
        * Process wants stronger isolation than a cooperative time sharing schme 
          in situation of multiple processes 
    - strong isolation
        * Forbid directly accessing sensitive hardwaree resources 
        * Abstract the resources into services
    - Processor provide hardware support for strong isolation
        * There are two modes when processor can execute instruction
        * kernel mode : execute privileged instruction in kernel space 
        * user mode : execute user-mode instruction in user space
        * kernel : the software running in kernel space (or in kernel mode) 
    - switching processor from user mode to kernel mode ( ex. I/O instruction )
        * Processor provides a special instruction for this
        * Procesoor enteres the kernel at an entry point specified by kernel
        * Kernel validate arguments of the system call to decide the requst can be allowed,
            and deny it or execute it
        

## 2 Kernel organization

   - monolithic kernel
      * Entire oprating system resides in kernel and runs with full hardware privilege
      * All system calls run in kernel mode
      * Advantage 
          + It is convenient because we need to care about which part of oprating system 
              should have full hardware privilege
          + It is easy for diffrent parts of operating sytem to cooperate 
      * Disadvantage
          + The interface between different parts of OS are often complex
          + Developer can make a mistake easily which is fatal to OS.
    - micro kernel
      * To reduce the risk from downside of monolithic kernel, amount of OS code is minimized
      * The bulk of the optaring system in user mode is executed
      * The kernel is relatively simple and most of operating system resides in user-level servers

## 3 Process overview

   - Process : unit of isolation in xv6
   - The process abstraction 
        * It prevents one process from wrecking or spying on another process's memory, CPU, file descriptors, etc.
        * It prevents a process from wrecking the kernel and subvetring kernel's isolation mechanism
    - address space 
        * The process abstraction gives illusion to a program 
            that it has own private machine for enforcing isolation
        * A Process provide what appears to be a private memory system 
            and its own CPU (for executing program instructions) to a program
        * Other process can not access each address space
      
## 3 Diary

       I reviewed the operating system organization in night because I should know exactly the flow of creating new process, 
       address space of user mode and kernel mode. The isolation is a penetrating concept for oprating system. 
       From this concept, it is important to manage address space differently in user-mode and kernel mode.
       
       In lab 1, to solve assignments, I organized requirements of each problem, concepts for solving problems, and author' intension.
       Expecially walk through questions is very useful to divide subproblems and subtask to achieve objectives for lab 1.
       
       Using gdb debugger, we should follow up the flow of creating, exiting and wating process. 
       It will be necessary study for understanding system call and trap handling. 
       Furthermore, I expect we get better comprehensive programming in system programming 
       keeping understanding fundamental operating system.
