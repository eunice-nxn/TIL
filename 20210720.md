### 1 How the scheduler works
+ Introduction
  + sched and scheduler are **co-routines** of each other
  + Find a process to run
  + Run the found process until it stops
+ Scheduler holds ptable.lock for most of its actions 
  + Scheduler realeases the lock once in each eateration of its outer loop (explicitly enables interrupts)
    + When CPU is idle (can find no RUNNABLE process)
      + If an idle scheduler looped with the lock continuously held no other CPU that was running a process
          1) could never perform a context switch	or any process-related system call
          2) could never mark a process as RUNNABLE process
            (so as to break the idling CPU out of its scheduling loop)
  + The reason to enable interrupts periodically on an idling CPU
    + There migit me no RUNNABLE process 
    + Because processes are waiting for I/O
    + If the scheduler left interrupts disabled all the time, the I/O would never arrive
+ The flow in infinite loop
  + The scheduler loops over the process table looking for a runnable process, one that has p->state == RUNNABLE
  + Once it finds a process
    + It sets the per-CPU current process variable proc
    + It switches to the process's page table with switchuvm
    + It marks the process as RUNNING
    + It calls swtch to start running it

### 2 How to implement scheduling policy

+ Scheduling policy
  + Round Robin
    1) It runs a job for a time slice (scheduling quantum)
    2) Switches to the next job in the run queue 
    3) It repeatedly does so until the jobs are finished
    4) Time slice
      + Note that the length of a time slice must be a multiple of the timer-interrupt period 
      + The shorter it is, the better performance of RR under the response-time metric
      + The Round Robin policy is excellent under only the response-time metric
      + But under a turn-around time metric, it is one of the worst policies
      
  + Multi-level Feedback Queue
    1) It tries to address 
      + a problem for optimizing turnaround time
      + a problem for minimizing response time
 
    2) Basic Rule
      + 1: If priority(A) > priority(B), A runs (B doesn't)
      + 2: If priority(A) = priority(B), A&B run in RR
      + 3: When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority (the topmost queue)
      + 4a: If a job uses up an entire time slice while running, its priority is reduced
      + 4b: If a job gives up the CPU before time slice is up, it stays at the same priority level
      
      
      
      
 ### Diary
 
     For an implementation of scheduler considering each process's priority, 
     it is not easy to edit scheduler function. Before editing scheduler.
     I added system call for getpriority and setpriority. 
     After fully testing execution of two system calls, 
     I started to check flow of scheduler and discussed about what scheduling policy is applied, 
     When Round Robin is applied, what is the additional variable for RR. 

     I had a difficulty to devise a scheduling policy and update newly scheduler. 
     Thus, in evening, I reviewed the flow of scheduler and existing scheduling policy.
     When I think Round Robin, it is very difficult that how the concept of time slice
     is applied in scheduling. Through evening study, I figured out the meaning of time slice 
     and exactly and how time slice works in multi-level feedback queue and Round Robin. 
     Based on this, tomorrow I would discuss how a concept of time slice can be applied 
     in our scheduler of xv6.
