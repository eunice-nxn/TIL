## 1 Variable argument list

   - <stdarg.h>
        It contains macros of functions accepting variable arguments list.
                  
                        #include <stdarg.h>

                          void va_start(va_list ap, last);
                          type va_arg(va_list ap, type);
                          void va_end(va_list ap);
                          void va_copy(va_list dest, va_list src);
                          
        * va_list 
           + a pointer to the stack frame of the variadic function
        * va_start
          +  Initialize ap for va_list
          +  On systems arguments are passed in register, va_start() is needed for allocating memory
        * va_arg
          + It expands to an expression that contains the type and value of the next argument in the call
          + It modifies ap for next call returns the next argument.
        * va_end 
          + On systemes arguments are padssed in register, va_end() can free the allocated memory again.
        * va_copy
          + It copies variable arguments list from source to destination
        
        
## 2 xv6 kernel

   - CR0_PG : It is control register flag for enabling paging
   - Before CRO_PG is set, memory reference is identity mapping from linear address to physical address 
   - After CR0_PG is set, memory reference is virtual addresses 
       which is translated by the virtual memory hardware to physical address
   - The stack 
      * esp register : It points to the lowest location of the stack
      * ebp register : It is a register which is base pointer and it is associated with software convention
      * The function's prologue : save the previous function's base pointer by pushing onto the stack 
        and copies the current esp value into ebp for the duration of the function

      
## 2 Diary

       I read xv6 codes related with process which kernel sets the page table and stack. 
       In addition, I try to understand printf.c and console.c in xv6. Meanwhile, I studied a variadic function I was curious 
       when looking at the system function in system programming study. A variadic function is a function accepting variable 
       number of arguments. I referenced man page of stdarg.h and figured out the variadic function in detail.
       Through today study, I thought it is very important when we read codes of one library or system, 
       we should not miss the main flow of code and trace the flow of assembly code using debuger.
