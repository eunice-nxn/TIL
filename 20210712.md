## 1 Physical address

  1 Introduction

  - Early PC
      * 8088 processor
      * Only 1MB Physical address is available
      * Low memory(640 KB) + Non-volatile memory (384 KB)
  - Modern PC
      * 80286, 80386 processor
      * 16MB, 4GB physical address memory are available.
  - Current PC 
      * x86 processor
      * More than 4GB of RAM is supported
     

   - BIOS ( Basic Input Output System )
      * Basic System Initialization
      * Loading OS 
      * Pass control of a machine to OS

  2 Boot Loader 
      - Before Boot Loader is executed,  
          * When BIOS find a bootable disk, a first sector which is boot sector and contains code of boot loader is loaded on memory.
          * Jump to CS:IP = 0000:7c00
          * Control of a machine is passed to boot loader
      - Transition 16 bit to 32 bit mode
      - Read kernel from IDE disk device register using special I/O of x86
                
## 2 GDB Debugger
  
   - b*addr : set break point
   - c : continue execution until break point
   - si : step instruction, execution one instruction
   - x.Ni addr : execute N instruction from addr


## 3 Diary

      I studied lab 0, tutorial which contains introduction of xv6 kernel, physical address and boot loader. 
      When reading OS meterial, xv6 kernel is often mentioned and I wonder how the xv6 kernel works as operating system.
      Today I figured out a process before booting OS. When I translationed segmented address to physical address 
      or read assembly code, i thought i should study computer architecture to improve weakness in physical address 
      computation or assembly syntax.
      
      If i studied alone xv6 kernel, I had difficulty to check what i understand and what i don't know.
      However, I studied together with my peer, I can understand xv6 kernel easily using dialog.
