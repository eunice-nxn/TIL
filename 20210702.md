                    int regexec(const regex_t *restrict preg, const char* restrict string,
                                  size_t nmatch, regmatch_t pmatch[restrict], int eflags);

       - POSIX regex compiling : regcomp()
          * For searching subsequently by regexec(), 
                      it is used to complie a regular expression into a proper format
          * preg : a pointer to pattern buffer storage area
          * regex : a pointer to the null-terminated string
          * cflags :  flags used to determine the type of comliation
            + REG_EXTENDED : use POSIX Extended Reqular Expression syntax when interpreing regex
                             if not set, POSIX Basic Reqular Expression syntax is used.
            + REG_ICASE : When regexec() searhes, the pattern buffer will be case insensitive. 
            + REG_NOSUB : the position of matches are not reported
                          When the pattern buffer supplied is compiled with this flag set,
                          the nmatch and pmatch of regexec() arguments are ignored.
            + REG_NEWLINE : Match-any-character operators don't match a newline
 
       - POSIX regex matching: regexec()  
          * It is used to match a null-terminated string 
                                        against the precompiled pattern buffer, preg.
          * nmatch, pmatch : they provides information regarding the location of the any matches
          * eflags : the bitwise-or of zero or more follwing things
              + REG_NOTBOL
              + REG_NOTEOL
              + REG_STARTEND
       - POSIX error reporting: regerror() 
          * It is useed to turn the error codes that can be returned 
            by both regcomp() and regexec() into error message strings.
          * errcode : error code
          * preg : the pattern buffer
          * errbuf : a pointer of a charcter string buffer
          * errbuf_size : the size of the string buffer
          * Return value : the size of errbuf 
       - POSIX pattern buffer freeing : regfree()
          * preg which is a pointer of pattern buffer will free by this function 

## 2 Diary

      I challenged making logical structure and control flow considering requirements of program 
      and exeception case in programming. Sometimes, I did programming without constructing 
      a logical flow. As a result, codes got to have too many lines and to be complicated 
      for other people to understand. In this week, i have to overcome this bad behavior 
      of me in programming.
      
      To make logical flow well, dividing cases in program is important. I tried to read 
      official document for function or library in linux manual page. 
      I figured out much easier the case of control flow in program considering requirements.
      In official document, they explained the meaning of arguments which is specific value,
      the reason why they return error code, and the kind of specific flags and their meanings.
      Thus i understanded well meanings of functions or library due to official documents
      and this helped me to make logic flow more clear than before.
      
      I still have a long way to go and there are the knowledges I do not know well 
      more than ones I know. Therefore, I should try to my best for immproving 
      the programming skill. I expect the road by the connecting dots I put as my best.
