### 1 lab2 ; implement priority scheduling

  + Edit system call 'getpriority' and 'setpriority'
  + Edit the range of priority for each process from \[0, 31\] to \[-10, 10\]
  + In fork for process, priority of a process is set to 0
  + Make test case for priority scheduling
      + I received several cases for checking execution of scheduler in priority scheduling from peers
  + Impelment a scheduler function in priority scheduling
      1) Determine a max value of priority for a runnable process in process table 
      2) Using cursor, find a process which has the determined max value and is runnable for context switch
      3) When a process is founded, context switch occurs
