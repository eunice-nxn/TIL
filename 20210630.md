## 1 Network 

  - A Client-Server Transaction
      - Client-Server model
          * Client process
          * Server process 
            + manage some resources
            + provide services to clients by manipulating resources
          * Key process
            1. Client sends request
            2. Server handles request
            3. Server sends response
            4. Client handles response
          * clients and servers are processes and they run on hosts 
  - Computer Networks
      - network: hierarchical system of boxes and wires organized by geographical proximity
          * SAN : System Area Network 
            + cluster, machine room
          * LAN : Local Area Network
            + a building, campus
          * WAN : Wide Area Network 
            + country, world
      - internetwork : interconnected set of networks
          * Global IP internet : most famous exmaple of an internet
  - The levels of structure for internet
      - Ethernet Segment
          * hub : it has ports which contact directly with wires of host
          * host : a collection of hosts are connected by wires
          * lowest level
          * spans room or floor in a building
          * Operation
              + It has unique address which is 48-bit (MAC address)
              + It sends frames which is chunk of bits
              + Hub copies each bit from each port to every other port
      - Bridged Ethernet Sement
          * bridge : it connects hub to hub
          * spans building or campus
          * view of LAN
             + hubs, bridges, and wires are marked as a single wire for simplicity
             + It seems like that a collection of hosts are attached to a single wire
      - internets
          * router : it is specialized computers 
                      which connect physically multiple incompatible LANs
          * internet : the connected networks
  - Internet Protocol
      - The notion of protocol 
          * A set of rule to definite a way of communication between networks
          * It makes possible to send bits across incompatible LANs and WANs
          * It smooths out the differences between the different networks
      - The jobs of protocol
          * It provides a naming scheme.
              + host address : uniform format of address
              + Each host is identified through its host address
          * It provides a delivery mechanism.
              + packet : standart unit for transferring data
                 - header : packet size, source and destination address
                 - payload : data bits sent from source host
      - TCP/IP protocol
          *  Global IP Internet is based on TCP/IP protocol family
          *  IP : Internet Protocol
              + It provides basic name shemes
              + It provides unreliable delivery capability of packets
          *  UDP : Unreliable Data Protocol
              + It uses IP to provide unreliable datagram delivery from process to process
          *  TCP : Transmission Control Protocol
              + It uses IP to provide reliable byte streams from process-to-process


## 2 Diary

      I studied network programming today. 
      I am worried about whether I understand well network 
      because network concept and many keywords of network is unfamilar.
      However, professor provided us mission to be able to expand 
      an area of understanding. Based on the missions, I recognized that 
      they are connected progressively from file I/O to network programming.
      I learned the importance of connecting concepts based on 
      blueprint or structure of notions. In addition, I want to learn 
      not only connecting the concepts in structure of notion, but also
      dividing one probelms into subproblems 
      and conquering thems for problem solving in programming.
      
      I spend a time to review of the code related with socket concept 
      with my colleagues. Through QnA, I examined what i understand in detail 
      and solved the difficulty of understanding flow of code. Through this study,
      i can experience the benefit of cooperation and effect of checking 
      how I understand well through question or explanation.
