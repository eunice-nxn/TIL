## 1 fread and fwrite

     size_t fread (void* ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE* stream)
     - It reads an array of elements whose size is 'count' and the size of each element is 'size'. It is from the locaton pointed by 'ptr' in the file 'stream'.
     - Return Value: the size of elements read successfully
     
     size_t fwrite (const void* ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE* stream)
     - It writes an array of elements whose size is 'count' and the size of each element is 'size'. It is from the locaton pointed by 'ptr' in the file 'stream'. 
     - Return Value: the size of elements written successfully



## 2 Stat System Call

    The status of a file is checked through this system call.  
    The stat() returns file attributes which is inode and contains metadata of the file.
    
      #include <sys/stat.h>
      
      int stat( const char *path, struct stat *buf)
      - Return Value: 0 (Success), -1 (Fail)
      - struct stat {
          mode_t st_mode;
          ino_t st_ino;
          dev_t st_dev;
          dev_t st_rdev;
          nlink_t st_nlink;
          uid_t st_uid;
          gid_t st_gid;
          off_t st_size;
          struct timspec st_atim;
          struct timespec st_mtim;
          struct timespec st_ctim;
          blksize_t st_blksize;
          blkcnt_t st_blocks;
       }
      
     - Especially, to retrieve the files or subdirectories, It is critical that the symbolic link or other special files should be excluded.
       'st_mode' is used as the key of considering this requirement. In addition, there are flags for representing different kind of file.
       
           S_IFMT : A bitmask used to get mode value of a file
           S_IFSOCK: A file constant of socket
           S_IFLNK: A file constant of symbolic link
           S_IFREG: A file constant for regular file
           S_IFBLK: A file constant for block file
           S_IFDIR: A file constant for directory file
           S_IFCHR: A file constant for character file
           S_IFIFO: A file constant for fifo


## 3 diary

    - I want to expand the power of metacognition. 
      I think it is critical to be able to distinguish what I know and what I don't know in learning.
      In this sense, it is very useful to explain my code to professor and peers. 
      Through the review of code, it gets to be straightforward that what is a contradiction or an ambiguity of logic in my code.
      Furthermore, I can get new insight of programming through feedback of other people.
    - As soon as the study was over, I was exhausted and fell asleep. 
      I was worried about concentration because I participated online.
      However, I was thankful that I was able to concentrate while receiving moderate stress, because it was a pretty intense schedule.
