## 1 getopt library

     #include <unistd.h>
     int getopt(int argc, char *consst argv[], const char *optstring);

   - It parses the command line arguments.

     - Arguments 
          * argc: the number of command line arguments
          * argv: the array of command line arguments
          * optstring: the dump of option characters
     - Return value: option character in integer form
     - Extern variable
          * optarg
          * optind
          * opterr
          * optopt
     - This function is repeteadly called and returns sequentially 'option characters'.

          #include <getopt.h>
          int getopt_long(int argc, char *const argv[], const char* optstring,
                             const struct option * longopts, int *longindex);

     - It works like getopt but it is different that getopt_long allows 
        long option which begins with "--".
     - Arguments
        * argc: see above explnation
        * argv: see above explnation
        * optstring: see above explnation
        * longopts: a pointer which points a first element of an array of struct option
                    it is delcared in <getopt.h>.
                    
                    struct option {
                      const char *name;   
                      int         has_arg;
                      int         *flag;
                      int         val;
                     }
                     
          + name : the name of option
          + has_arg : the legimated value for determining the existence of option argument
                    no_argument (or 0), required_argument (or 1), optional_argument (or 2)
          + flag : It determines the return value of getopt_long function in case of long option
          + val : the value pointed by flag
          + In the option array, the last element of the array should be filled with 0.
          + If flag is NULL, getopt_long() returns val.
          + If flag is not NULL and option is found, 
                getopt_long() returns 0 and flag points to a a variable which is set to val.
                if option is not found in this case, a variable pointed by flag left unchanged.
        * longindex
     - Return value: option characters in integer form 


## 2 Diary

      At final meeting in end of today, i was remainded the importance of testing program.
      The gap exists definitely between whether input of the different size or case 
      for processing exception is considered or tested. When I had to show working well my program 
      considering the wide range of input cases directly as homework of course, I was embrassed. 
      Because I've never done testing my program with different input cases or other standard 
      before that homework. Through that homework, I recognized the importance of testing program.
      With different input, I can figure out the several loopholes of the program which was difficult to find.
      Today, I can learn cooperation in programming or development. 
      Through the discussion of the exception case which we should consider in programming requirement, 
      I got the new point which I may miss. Professor let us know the benefit of cooperation and developemnt.
      We discussed the different case of exception or requirement in command line interface 
      and shared the test case files for testing program. It is important to prove my code to others and thus.
      I would practice proper testing of my program and explanation of logical flow in code to improve my metarecognition!
