## 1 Process overview

   - Page table is used to give each process its own address space
        * translating virtual address to physical address
        * virtual address : address that an x86 instruction manipulates
        * physical address : address that the processor chip sends to main memory
        * a seperate page table for each process is maninatained as process's address space
        * layout of virtual address 
            + To make the kernel's system call code to refer directly to user memory
            + user memory : virtual address 0
                1. instruction
                2. global variable
                3. stack
                4. heap area
            + kernel : high virtual address 0x80100000
                1. kernel's instruction
                2. data
    - struct proc
        * many pieces of state for each process is gathered into struct proc
        * The state
            + its page table
            + kernel stack
            + run state
        * A thread of execution
            + Each process has a thread which executes instructions of the process
            + It can be suspended and later resumed
            + In switching processes transparently, the kernel suspends the current running thread 
              and resumes a thread of another process
            + The state of thread
              1. local variable
              2. function call return address
            + The state of thread is stored on the thread's stacks
        * The stack of process
            + user stack
            + kernel stack 
            + In user mode, user stack is used only and kernel stack is empty
            + In kernel mode, the kernel code is executed on the kernel stack 
                 , data of user stack is maintained but isn't actively used
            + A thread of process alternates between actively using its user stack and its kernel stack
            + kernel stack is seperated because the kernel can execute even if a process has wrecked it user stack
         * stack switch when process make a system call
            + processor switches to the kernel stack
            + The hardware privilege level is raised
            + The kernel instruction that implement the system call is executed
            + When the system call completes, ther kernel returns to user space
            + The hardware lowers its privilege level
            + The hardware switches back to the user stack and resume executing user instructions 
              just after the system call instruction
            + If a process thread should wait I/O, the thread can "block" in the kernel
          * p->state : It indicates whether the process is allocated, ready to run, running, waiting for I/O, or exiting
          * p->pgdir : It holds the page table of process and it serves as the record of the address of the physical pages
                      allocated to strore the memory of the process
        

## 2 Assembly trap handlers

   - int instruction : It helps processor to genreate trap.
   - 256 interrupts in x86
      * 0-31 software interrupt
      * 32-63 hardware interrupt
      * 64 system call interrupt
   - Tvinit
      * it is called from main
      * It sets up the 256 entries in the interrupt descriptor table
      * Each interrupt i is handled by the code at the address in vectors[i]
      * 64 system call interrupt
          + T_SYSCALL : the user system call trap
          + DPL_USER : system call gate privilege which allows a user program 
                        to generate a trap with an explicit int instruction
          + xv6 doesn't allow other interrupts and if other interrupts is raised by user program, 
            general protection exception occurs
      * SETGATE : It sets istrap flag of all interrupt to 0 and specifies the gate is of type trap 
                  by passing 1 as second argument
   - The hardware When a trap occurs
       * trap occurs in user mode 
          + It loads %exp and %ss from the task segment descriptor
          + It pushes the old user %ss and %esp onto the new stack
       * trap occurs in kernel mode 
          + none of the above things happens
       * The processor pushes the %eflags, %cs, and %eip registers 
       * For some traps, an error word is pushed 
       * The processor loads %eip and %cs from the relevant IDT entry
   - Perl script
      * It generates entry points that the IDT entries point to
      * Each entry pushes an error code if the processor didn't pushes and pushes the interrupt number 
      * jump to alltraps
   - Alltraps
      * It continues to save processor registers
      * it pushes %ds, %es, %fs, %s, and the general purpose registers
      * struct trapframe
          + It contains the processor registers at the time of trap
          + The processor pushes %ss, %esp, %eflags, %cs and %eip
          + It is necessary to restore the user mode when the kernel returns to the current process
      * setting up the processor to run kernel C code
          + %cs and %ss : the selectors ; The processor set them before entering the handler
          + %ds and %es
          + %fs abd %gs to point at the SEG_KCPU per CPU data segment
      * call trap
      * After trap returns, alltraps pops the argument off the stack by adding to the stack pointer
      * trapret : starts executing the code at this label
      
   
       
     
     
## 3 Diary

       I studied when trap occurs, assemlby trap handlers. In evening, I reviewed also address space 
       for user stack and kernel stack. I had a difficulty a concept of stack switch, I should review 
       when the stack switch occurs and how stack switch is achieved. By reading textbook repeatedly, 
       I solved the difficulty in understanding context and flow of stack switch.
       
       In lab 1, we should implement exit system call and wait system call which return exit status 
       of terminated process through arugment. Reading textbook with checking the flow when trap occurs, 
       we understanded how aruments are passed between user mode and kernel mode.
       In addition, we thought the things to be considered when the prototype of existing sytem calls
       is changed and edited the system call according to given requirements.
       It was the time to study system call deeply and expand the knowledge of OS.
