### Compeleted Task in implementation
#### Cyclic deadlock monitor
  1. Probe part : ddmon.c
    - Overriding **pthread_mutex_lock** and **pthread_mutex_unlock**
      - Through named pipe, send **runtime information** to **ddchck**
  2. Checker part : ddchchck.c
    - Through named pipe, receive **runtime information** from **ddmon**
  3. Target program for deadlock
    - new_target.c 
      - deadlock example program of peers


### The task to do

  1. Based on the cyclic deadlock monitoring algorithm, draw directly lock graphs
  2. Devise how ddchck detect deadlock through cycles of graph for acquiring and releasing lock

#### Cyclic deadlock monitoring algorithm
  - Monitor lock acuires and releases in runtime
  - Lock graph ( N, E_N)
  - When a thread acquire lock X, a node n_x is created
  - When a thread holding lock X acuire lock Y, a edge ( n_x, n_y ) is created
  - When a thread releases lock X, ( \*, n_x ) edges are removed and if there are no threads which had acquired X, a node n_x is removed
  - When the graph has any cycle, the deadlock is reported


### Today I Implemented
  - Lock graph
    * Based on struct **Node** and struct **Edge**, I devised member functions for initializing, inserting to list, deleting to list
    * Directly drawing lock graphs, I thought and discussed about different cases for dead lock considering number of lock and number of thread
    * Through several testing from example program of deadlock, I found what needs to be improved and I supplemented them in implementing lock graph.
